# Express RESTAPI

This project is implemented as a test.

## Use of the `.env` variables:

The environment variables:
 ```  
DB_CONNECTION=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=test
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=a
```  

You can edit values according to your own database personal preference. I am using Postgres in this case.
